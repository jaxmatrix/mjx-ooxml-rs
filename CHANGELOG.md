# Changelog

All notable changes to **mjx-ooxml-rs** are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## Versioning

The project is pre-release and uses `v0.0.x`: the patch number is incremented each development
iteration until the first milestone. Milestones then advance the minor version:

- **`v0.1`** — PowerPoint (`.pptx`) complete
- **`v0.2`** — Word (`.docx`) complete
- **`v0.3`** — Excel (`.xlsx`) complete

Further milestones (rendering, bindings, …) are defined as that work is scheduled. The public API is
**not** stable until `v0.1`.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-07-15

First versioned snapshot. Establishes the workspace, the packaging + fidelity + compatibility core,
the schema-type generator, and full documentation. No format models yet.

### Added

- **Packaging (Phase 0)** — `mjx-opc`: load an OOXML package fully into RAM as an ordered part graph,
  parse `[Content_Types].xml` and `_rels/*.rels`, and re-zip with per-part decompressed-byte identity.
  Minimal namespace-resolving reader in `mjx-xml`.
- **Schema codegen (Phase 0)** — `xtask` generates `mjx-ooxml-types` (namespace table +
  `shared-commonSimpleTypes`) with comprehensive, self-explanatory names and exact wire tokens;
  output is deterministic and committed.
- **Fidelity layer (Phase 1)** — `mjx-ooxml-core` string interner + the `RawDocument` preservation
  tree, and `mjx-xml::fidelity`, a byte-preserving reader + hand-written writer. Parsing then
  re-serializing any part reproduces the source **byte-for-byte** (verified on real `.pptx`/`.docx`/
  `.xlsx` fixtures).
- **Markup Compatibility (Phase 1)** — `mjx-mce`: preserve mode (the untouched tree) and a
  non-mutating resolve mode (`AlternateContent` Choice/Fallback, `Ignorable`, `ProcessContent`,
  `MustUnderstand`).
- **Documentation** — comprehensive rustdoc across all crates (crate guides + runnable examples), a
  facade docs hub (`mjx-ooxml`), enforced via `missing_docs` and a strict-rustdoc CI job.
- **Project** — CI (fmt/clippy/test + wasm/Android/iOS/macOS/Windows cross-compile build matrix),
  dual `MIT OR Apache-2.0` license, and the contributor/agent guides.

### Notes

- Cross-platform: pure-Rust dependency graph; the library crates cross-compile to
  `wasm32-unknown-unknown`, `aarch64-linux-android`, and Apple/Windows targets.
- A broader multi-producer sample corpus and fuzzing are planned for later iterations.
